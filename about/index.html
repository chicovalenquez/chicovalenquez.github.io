        Dadmobile Records is a pants-hating DIY recording collective out of Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dadmobile Records was founded in 2000 as collective of bands in the K-W area that banded together to
        try to overcome the limited resources available in the area at the time,
        eventually expanding to a group of people helping to promote shows and recorded music in the K-W area.
        The accompanying Dadmobile Radio moved from an online podcast (before podcasts existed) about Dadmobile 
        bands and KW events, to an over-the-airwaves radio show on CKMS FM focused on the expanding K-W music 
        scene of the early 2000s. 
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Most of the people involved in Dadmobile Records believed in the Mayan prophecy that the world would end in 2012. 
        As such, Dadmobile Radio came to a conclusion and most bands on the label stopped performing 
        or writing music in anticipation of there being no more world to play music in.
        This resulted in a near decade-long hiatus where only one Dadmobile band would release any music as a sort of beacon
        signal to any surviving music fans.
        When it became apparent that humanity was going to survive cataclysm after the COVID-19 pandemic,
        Dadmobile Records returned like a confused phoenix with a flurry of new releases and performances in 2024.
        Although we have no ruled out the possibility at the world did end and this is all a simulation. 
        It would make more sense than what has happened.
