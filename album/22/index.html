        <div>Knock Knock Ginger, or KKG as the cool kids call them, is probably the most wonderful band I know. They have been together continuously for longer than any other band on the label. They were once called the best prom band that has never played a prom. They are the only band on the label to ever play theremin live and they have the most songs featuring trumpet. Knock Knock Ginger has had more female members and more fantasy football players than any other band on Dadmobile.</div>

		<div>BOATS, as it's called to those in the know, was KKG's Christmas present to the year 2006.  Although it presented the same number of songs as <em>Hurry!</em>, it took two steps forward in defining KKG's sound.  This album has the fewest animals of any KKG album cover.  </div>
